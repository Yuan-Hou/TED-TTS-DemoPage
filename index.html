      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        While controllable Text-to-Speech (TTS) has achieved notable progress, most existing methods remain limited to inter-utterance-level control, 
        making fine-grained intra-utterance expression challenging due to their reliance on non-public datasets or complex multi-stage training. 
        In this paper, we propose TED-TTS, a training-free controllable framework for pretrained zero-shot TTS to enable intra-utterance emotion and duration expression. 
        Specifically, we propose a segment-aware emotion conditioning strategy that combines causal masking with monotonic stream alignment filtering to isolate emotion conditioning and schedule mask transitions, 
        enabling smooth intra-utterance emotion shifts while preserving global semantic coherence. Based on this, 
        we further propose a segment-aware duration steering strategy to combine local duration embedding steering with global EOS logit modulation, 
        allowing local duration adjustment while ensuring globally consistent termination. To eliminate the need for segment-level manual prompt engineering, 
        we construct a 30,000-sample multi-emotion and duration-annotated text dataset to enable LLM-based automatic prompt construction. 
        Extensive experiments demonstrate that our training-free method not only achieves state-of-the-art intra-utterance consistency in multi-emotion and duration control, 
        but also maintains baseline-level speech quality of the underlying TTS model.

            The above audio samples present comparative results for intra-utterance multi-emotion control using speech-referenced emotion prompts.
            Since comparative methods lack intra-utterance controllability, all segments are synthesized
            independently and concatenated for evaluation.
            <u>Our method demonstrates smooth and coherent emotion transitions within a single utterance,
            along with consistent speaker similarity across segments, where subtle breath sounds at
            segment boundaries can also be perceived.</u>
            Although baseline methods show strong emotion preservation at the segment level, this advantage
            largely stems from their independent segment synthesis setting.
            In contrast, our method <u>performs multi-segment emotion control within a single generation</u>,
            which makes emotion category preservation more challenging but better reflects realistic
            controllable speech synthesis scenarios.

            The above audio samples present comparative results for intra-utterance multi-emotion control
              using text-referenced emotion prompts.
              Compared with speech-based emotion prompting, extracting emotion cues from natural language
              descriptions is considerably more challenging.
              Despite this increased difficulty, our method still demonstrates
              <u>smooth intra-utterance emotion transitions,
              consistent speaker timbre across segments, and
              strong multi-emotion controllability within a single utterance.</u>

                The above audio samples present comparative results for intra-utterance duration control using speech-referenced emotion prompts.
                  For duration control experiments, the emotion category is fixed to neutral,
                  and segment-level speech synthesis is evaluated under four duration scaling
                  factors (×0.75, ×0.875, ×1.125, and ×1.25).
                  The results show that, after extending controllability to duration,
                  our method consistently preserves smooth intra-utterance transitions and
                  coherent speaker timbre across segments.
                  Moreover, our framework enables flexible duration adjustment for a target
                  segment while keeping other segments unchanged, demonstrating strong
                  training-free controllability within an autoregressive TTS framework.
